<h1>Symple Unzipper Challenge</h1>
<p>
    Have you ever received a pesky ZIP file and not been able to extract it? No worries! This web server can do it for
    you.
</p>
<p>
    This web server has a REST API endpoint that will receive a ZIP file via HTTP POST and return a JSON object
    containing the decompressed contents of every file inside the ZIP.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="/docs">API documentation is available here</a>. The documentation also includes forms to upload ZIP
    files directly from your browser.
</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>
    Unfortunately, this server has a bug that can be exploited to exfiltrate local files. A flag has been saved in
    a file named <code>flag.txt</code> in the same directory as the server code. Your job is to exploit the bug and get
    the flag.
</p>
<p>
    Solving the challenge does not involve denial of service or things like ZIP bombs. Please don't do that.
    HINT: There is a special type of file you will need to craft.

</p>
<h2>The Code</h2>
<p>
    You can <a href="/server.tar.gz">download the source code to the server</a> (minus the flag file!).
    It contains a <code>README.md</code> with further instructions.
